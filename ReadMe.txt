Hello, this repository meant for making tools for Unity and Fmod, creating audio solutions and making audio easier for programmers and programming easier for sound heads.
I'll put here all the scripts and attach unity packages for every section.

1.Assets -> Import Package and import the unity package
2.Check out the audiomanager, it will contain most of everything.
3.Audiomanager will control the surroundings and to get quick sounds you can always use the sfxGenerator script.
